# jumping hurdles to understand the neural control of movement
While the neural control of some simple types of movement is well understood, how the brain coordinates complex, whole-body behavior remains a mystery. For my PhD research I developed a closed loop system in which mice run on top of a wheel and skillfully leap over motorized hurdles while I record from their brains. I developed a custom linear motion system along with custom microcontroller software that moves hurdles towards mice at the same speed that mice are running, simulating what it is like to jump over stationary objects. Using a motion tracking system I then relate the 3D movements of mice to the activity of neurons that control these movements.
